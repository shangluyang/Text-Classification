# Text-Classification
Text classification is one of the popular tasks in Natural Language Processing,
which aims to assign labels or tags to given text documents such as sentences or
paragraphs. Deep learning models have achieved remarkable results in various
tasks related to text classification. In this paper, we are interested in analyzing the
performance of two deep learning models TextCNN and BERT on text classification.
We trained the TextCNN model and Finetune Bert model on THUCNews dataset
and compared them with a traditional machine learning model. The experimentâ€™s
result indicates that the accuracy of deep learning models has achieved much better
results than traditional machine learning models
